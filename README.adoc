= Spring Boot for Apache Geode & Pivotal GemFire

_Spring Boot for Apache Geode & Pivotal GemFire_ extends http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[_Spring Boot_] with
_auto-configuration_ support as well as other _convention or configuration_ features to simplify the development
of _Spring_ applications using either http://geode.apache.org/[Apache Geode] or https://pivotal.io/pivotal-gemfire[Pivotal GemFire]
in a _Spring_ context.

This project builds on both https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-geode[_Spring Data for Apache Geode_]
and http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-gemfire/[_Spring Data for Pivotal GemFire_]
as well as https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot].

=== Project Goals

This project adds _Spring Boot_ **auto-configuration** support for both http://geode.apache.org/[Apache Geode]
and https://pivotal.io/pivotal-gemfire[Pivotal GemFire].

Among other things, this project builds on http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[_Spring Boot_]
as well as http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-gemfire/[_Spring Data for Apache Geode & Pivotal GemFire_]
and additionally offers...

1. _Auto-configures_ an _Apache Geode_ or _Pivotal GemFire_ http://geode.apache.org/releases/latest/javadoc/org/apache/geode/cache/client/ClientCache.html[ClientCache]
instance automatically when either _Spring Data for Apache Geode_ or _Spring Data for Pivotal GemFire_
are on the application's CLASSPATH.

2. _Auto-configures_ either _Apache Geode_ or _Pivotal GemFire_ as a _caching provider_ in http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#cache[_Spring's Cache Abstraction_]
when either _Spring Data for Apache Geode_ or _Spring Data for Pivotal GemFire_ are on the application's CLASSPATH.

3. _Auto-configures_ _Spring Data for Apache Geode_ or _Spring Data for Pivotal GemFire_
http://docs.spring.io/spring-data-gemfire/docs/current/reference/html/#gemfire-repositories[Repositories]
when _Spring Data for Apache Geode_ or _Spring Data for Pivotal GemFire_ are on the application's CLASSPATH
and _Spring Boot_ detects SDG _Repositories_ in your _Spring Boot_ application.

4. Provides additional support for _Spring Boot_/_Spring Data for Apache Geode_/_Pivotal GemFire_ applications
deployed to PCF using either the Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC) or Session State Caching (SSC) services.
Also, when using SSC, you can also take advantage of
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session-data-geode[_Spring Session for Apache Geode/Pivotal GemFire_].

5. As an added benefit, _Spring Boot for Pivotal GemFire_ will automatically authenticate your _Spring Boot_, _Pivotal GemFire_ based application
when deployed to PCF and the application is granted access to a secure PCC instance for all of its caching concerns.

This, along with many other things will be provided in and by this project.
